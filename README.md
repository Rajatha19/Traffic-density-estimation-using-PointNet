# ðŸš˜ 3D Traffic Density Estimation using PointNet & nuScenes

Implemented and experimented with the **PointNet architecture** for 3D point cloud processing and object detection using the large-scale **nuScenes autonomous driving dataset**. This project processes multi-sensor data (LiDAR, cameras, radar) to detect and classify traffic density in 3D space, leveraging deep learning on raw, unstructured point clouds.
